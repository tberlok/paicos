abstract = {Dynamic, interpreted languages, like Python, are attractive for domain-experts and scientists experimenting with new ideas. However, the performance of the interpreter is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time compiler for Python that focuses in scientific and array-oriented computing. Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},

abstract = {A number of methods for constructing bounding volume hierarchies and point-based octrees on the GPU are based on the idea of ordering primitives along a space-filling curve. A major shortcoming with these methods is that they construct levels of the tree sequentially, which limits the amount of parallelism that they can achieve. We present a novel approach that improves scalability by constructing the entire tree in parallel. Our main contribution is an in-place algorithm for constructing binary radix trees, which we use as a building block for other types of trees.},
